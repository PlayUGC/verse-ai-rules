# Feature Request Template

When handling feature requests, use this systematic approach to break down complex features and implement them step by step.

## Feature Request Analysis & Implementation Plan

### 1. Feature Request Summary
[Restate the user's request concisely, ensuring you've captured the core requirements]

### 2. Feature Breakdown
- Component A: [Brief description]
- Component B: [Brief description]
- Component C: [Brief description]
[Break the feature into logical components or modules]

### 3. Clarification Questions
[List key questions about:
- Requirements and specifications
- Edge cases to handle
- Integration points with existing code
- User experience considerations
- Performance requirements]

### 4. Technical Approach
[After clarifications, outline:
- Overall architecture approach
- Key technologies/patterns to use
- Data structures and algorithms
- Integration strategy with existing code]

### 5. Implementation Plan
[Create a step-by-step breakdown of implementation tasks:
1. Task 1: [Description]
2. Task 2: [Description]
3. Task 3: [Description]
...]

### 6. Next Steps
Would you like me to build this feature out step by step following this plan?

## Implementation Tracking Template

Once approved, create a tasks.md file with implementation tracking:

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks

## Task 1: [Task Name] ✅
- Subtask 1
- Subtask 2
- Subtask 3

## Task 2: [Task Name] ⏳
- Subtask 1
- Subtask 2
- Subtask 3

## Task 3: [Task Name] ⬜
- Subtask 1
- Subtask 2
- Subtask 3

Legend:
✅ Complete
⏳ In Progress
⬜ Not Started
```

For each task:
1. Implement the code/changes
2. Show the implementation to the user
3. Get feedback and make adjustments
4. Mark as complete when approved
5. Move to the next task
