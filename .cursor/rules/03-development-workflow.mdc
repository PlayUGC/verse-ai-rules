# Development Workflow

## Design-First Approach

Before starting implementation, always review the feature request template at `.windsurf/07-feature-request-template.md` to ensure proper planning and documentation of new features.

### 1. Analyze Requirements
- Identify core functionality needed
- Determine required systems and components
- Consider performance implications
- Identify potential risks or challenges

### 2. Create High-Level Design
- Outline main components and their responsibilities
- Define data flow between components
- Plan state management approach
- Document integration points with existing systems

### 3. Break Down Tasks
- Split work into small, testable units
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Plan for incremental implementation
- Set clear success criteria for each component

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- Start with core functionality
- Add features incrementally
- Test each component in isolation
- Document as you go

## Code Review Guidelines

### Before Submitting Code
1. Verify against reference files
2. Check for consistent style
3. Ensure proper error handling
4. Document complex logic
5. Include test cases

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows project patterns
- [ ] Handles edge cases
- [ ] Includes documentation
- [ ] Meets performance requirements
- [ ] Passes all tests

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between systems
- Test error recovery

### Performance Testing
- Profile critical paths
- Check memory usage
- Verify frame rate targets

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments
- Use `#` for single-line comments
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain "why" not just "what"

### API Documentation
- Document parameters and return values
- Include usage examples
- Note any side effects

### Changelog
- Track significant changes
- Reference related issues
- Note breaking changes
